Quote:

"I just graduated from the Master in Geospatial Technologies [...] I recently had an interview with a company [...] and they have sent me an exercise to complete.

* I have spatio-temporal movement data (signalling event data from a mobile network with over 8000 subscribers) with four columns (ID, time, lat, long). The instructions say:

*    The aim is to manipulate the data in a manner where you can identify the movement patterns of individuals and in a representation, which will allow you to perform the second part of the assignment.
*    You can solve the challenge either by writing code in any programming language of your choice (like Python, R, Scala, etc.). (Iâ€™m using R) 
*    Your main task will be to filter the data and then to classify them based on their movement patterns. The compulsory part consists of the following tasks:
*    Find the most suitable configuration for identifying individual subscriber traces and apply it on the dataset.
*    Identify the parts of the traces which can be considered as activities. For a gentle introduction to the topic refer to the relevant Wikipedia article. We encourage you to select the definition of activities you would like to use but keep in mind that you will need to reason why you selected the given definition. 

The next part involves visualisation"
